        <h2>Built on Simple Values</h2>
        <p>Chapter Café started as a simple idea: create a place where quality isn't rushed. Where your flat white is made properly, where the croissant is still warm, and where you're genuinely welcome to stay as long as you'd like.</p>
        <p>We opened in 2018 after spending years learning from roasters, baristas, and bakers who showed us that doing things right takes time. Now we're here for the neighborhood—serving coffee we're proud of and food that tastes like care went into it.</p>
        <p>This isn't about trends or concepts. It's about showing up every day and making something worth your time.</p>

        <h3>Quality First</h3>
        <p>We'd rather close early than serve something we're not proud of. From bean selection to milk temperature, we pay attention to the things most places skip.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Community Minded</h3>
        <p>We're part of this neighborhood. We know your order, we host local artists, and we show up for the people who show up for us.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Thoughtful Always</h3>
        <p>From our suppliers to our waste management, we make decisions that align with our values. Doing good business means doing right by people and the planet.</p>
